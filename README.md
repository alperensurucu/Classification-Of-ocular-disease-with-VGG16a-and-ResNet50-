# Classification-Of-ocular-disease-with-VGG16-and-ResNet50-
(ODIR-5K is a dataset used for identifying and classifying eye diseases. Therefore, this project is a software development project that uses machine learning or deep learning methods to classify eye diseases.).(Software that can be used in this project includes deep learning libraries (such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch), image processing libraries (such as OpenCV), data analysis libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy), and different tools that can be used for model training (such as Jupyter Notebook)Classification of Eye Diseases from the Appearance of the Iris within the scope of the engineering project course. In this project, the ODIR5K dataset containing 70000 images was used to classify eye diseases from iris appearance. 30% images were used for testing, 70% images were used for the training phase. Added augmentation phase for better training results. The correct epoch value has been determined. The aim of my thesis is to classify and diagnose eye diseases in a short time and to reduce the workload of specialist ophthalmologists. Accuracy values ​​were displayed as average. Two networks were used and 2 different methods were compared. The same data set was used for accurate comparison. These methods are VGG16 and ResNet50. It is expected to work more stable and with higher performance by using another network and changing its method.
